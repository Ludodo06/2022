    "1.3 A common way to measure success in online A/B tests is what is called \"the clickthrough rate.\" Given that often A/B tests are created to find what engages users (here, \"packages\" of headlines, images, etc), we would expect that a \"good\" package makes people click often. Create a column named ctr by dividing the number of clicks a package received (clicks column) by the number of impressions it received (impressions column)."
